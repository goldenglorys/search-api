- TypeScript with a strict mode. All types have to be explicitly specified.
  Express. The last version fully supports async/await, so no callback and no explicit promises in our routes/controllers.

- PostgreSQL. This time a relational database. Let’s see how easy it’s to use.
  TypeORM — powerful ORM written in TypeScript, supports migrations, Active Record, has an excellent query builder and much more.

- Winston — A logger for just about everything :)

- Redis. We will use this in-memory store for caching. It’s going to one extra line of code which makes a huge difference in performance.

- PM2 — process manager for node.js apps, it includes clustering, load balancing, simple terminal monitoring, and log management.
