# the Node.js event loop uses only one core of a processor to execute its code.
# Node.js has a cluster module to spawn child processes — worker processes. They all share the same port.
# But instead of spawning processes directly with the cluster module we will use PM2 —
# Process Manager for Node.js. It has great features like a load balancing and auto-restarting node instances.
# Specify how many instances we want to create.
# The script which will be executed to start an app
# Set the exec_mode to cluster, so PM2 know we want to load balance between each instance.

apps:
  - script: ./dist/server.js
    instances: max
    exec_mode: cluster
